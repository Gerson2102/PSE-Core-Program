# Week 1 - Cryptographic Basics

## Practical

In each of our modules, we will have a practical component so that you can get some hands-on experience as soon as possible. In this module, we will first start with some basics about circuit writing with Circom.

### Getting Started with Circom (syntax + zkrepl)

In order to get used to writing circuits, we will start with [zkREPL](https://zkrepl.dev/), which is an online REPL that allows you to write and compile Circom circuits in the browser (with no setup required). There are many good videos on Circom, such as this one:

- [Circom Workshop 1 by 0xParc [1:31:06]](https://learn.0xparc.org/materials/circom/learning-group-1/circom-1/) - A very good introduction to Circom circuits.

However, we recommend you work through a few of the following example scenarios with zkREPL first. This way you can gain some familiarity with the syntax without having to setup the environment and dig into too much detail. Afterwards, you can review the video and fill in any gaps.

#### Hello World - Addition

This is one of the simplest examples of a ZK circuit. This circuit checks that the `sum` is the addition of two numbers `a` and `b`. Copy-and-paste the following into zkREPL, and compile it in the browser.

```circom
pragma circom 2.1.6;

template AdditionProof() {
    // declaration of signals
    signal input a;
    signal input b;
    signal output sum;

    // constraint
    sum <== a + b;
}

component main = AdditionProof();

/* INPUT = {
    "a": 3,
    "b": 5
} */
```

Note that the `a` and `b` are the private inputs.

### Write a circuit to prove multiplication

From there, let's try to write a circuit to prove the multiplication of two numbers!

Once that works, try to make a circuit to prove the multiplication of three numbers.

Make sure to save these circuits and present them at the end of the week.

### Write a circuit to prove input to hash

Now let's take it to the next level, we will write a circuit to prove the input to a hash. In order to do this, we will use the Poseidon hashing algorithm. You will need to include the following line at the top:

```circom
include "circomlib/poseidon.circom";
```

Here's how you'd use the Poseidon hashing function:

```circom
component hasher = Poseidon(1);
hasher.inputs[0] <== preimage;
hashOutput <== hasher.out;
```

You might want to research what a `component` is in the Circom syntax.

Use this as the input:

```circom
/* INPUT = {
    "preimage": "12345",
    "hash": "4267533774488295900887461483015112262021273608761099826938271132511348470966"
} */
```

Save the full answer to be submitted at the end of this module!

### Write a circuit to add two numbers on an elliptic curve

We don't dive in the details of elliptic curves in this module, but we can still write a simple circuit to add two numbers on an elliptic curve by importing the `babyjub.circom` file and add the points together.
Link to this code is [here](https://gist.github.com/NOOMA-42/1a9040d49a0a828075971cb50acc4adb)

```circom
// Code modified from circomlib test
pragma circom 2.1.6;

include "circomlib/circuits/babyjub.circom";

template AddNumOnEllipticCurve() {
    signal input x1;
    signal input y1;
    signal input x2;
    signal input y2;
    // To check xout yout
    signal input xout;
    signal input yout;
    component babyAdd = BabyAdd();
    babyAdd.x1 <== x1;
    babyAdd.y1 <== y1;
    babyAdd.x2 <== x2;
    babyAdd.y2 <== y2;
    xout === babyAdd.xout;
    yout === babyAdd.yout;
}

component main = AddNumOnEllipticCurve();

/* INPUT = {
    "x1": "17777552123799933955779906779655732241715742912184938656739573121738514868268",
    "y1": "2626589144620713026669568689430873010625803728049924121243784502389097019475",
    "x2": "17777552123799933955779906779655732241715742912184938656739573121738514868268",
    "y2": "2626589144620713026669568689430873010625803728049924121243784502389097019475",
    "xout": "6890855772600357754907169075114257697580319025794532037257385534741338397365",
    "yout": "4338620300185947561074059802482547481416142213883829469920100239455078257889"
} */
```

### Write a circuit to prove inclusion in Merkle tree

TtheBC01 has a good example of a Merkle tree circuit [here](https://github.com/TtheBC01/zkSNARK-playground/blob/main/examples/merkle-tree/tree.circom)

The main component is Poseidon hash. Poseidon hash maps sequences of elements to a fixed-length sequence of elements. You can use it to hash messages of arbitrary length or fixed length (such as in a Merkle tree, where typically two elements are hashed). Here you initialize the Poseidon hash with n = 2

You may also need a Mux. Mux is a component that takes two inputs and outputs one of them based on a selector. In this case, the selector is the index of the element in the Merkle tree.
```circom
poseidons[i] = Poseidon(2);
mux[i] = MultiMux1(2);
```

### Tips

You can always reference circomlib for examples of how to use existing circuits. You can find the circomlib [here](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib). Writing a simple circuit is not too dififcult, but it can be a bit tricky to get the constraints right and optimize the circuit. circomlib has many examples that you can use as a reference.

### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption (AES, RSA)

Encryption is a technique used to encode data, making it readable only to those who possess the correct decryption key. There are two main types of encryption - symmetric and asymmetric, each serving different purposes and with their own strengths and weaknesses.

**Symmetric Encryption** - Also known as single-key encryption, this method involves using the same key for both encryption and decryption. The most widely used symmetric encryption algorithm is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

**Asymmetric Encryption** - Also known as public-key encryption, this method uses a pair of keys: one for encryption and another for decryption. The RSA algorithm is one of the best known public-key algorithms.

The key difference between the two is the number of keys used: symmetric encryption uses one key for both encrypting and decrypting, while asymmetric encryption uses a different key for each (one public, one private).

### Hash Functions, Merkle Trees

#### Hash Functions

A hash function takes an input and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. **SHA-256** and **Poseidon** are popular cryptographic hash functions in our context, with Poseidon specifically designed for arithmetic-friendly operations, benefiting certain applications in blockchains.

The primary characteristics of a good hash function are [preimage resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack), second preimage resistance, and [collision resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance), ensuring data security and integrity. In blockchain technology, hash functions create an unalterable, unique representation of each block's content, contributing to the immutability and transparency of the system.

### Digital Signatures (Schnorr)

Digital signatures ensure the integrity and authenticity of digital messages or documents. By providing a means to verify the origin and confirm that the content has not been altered, digital signatures play a pivotal role in maintaining trust in digital communications.

In PKC, anyone can encrypt their message with the receiver's public key, and only the receiver can decrypt the message with their private key. In digital signatures, on the other hand, if a signer generates a signature for a message using their private key, anyone can validate it using the signer's public key. Therefore, the message of the signature is made public, which distinguishes it from cryptographic commitments.

### DLP-based Public-Key Cryptography (DLP, DH, Elgamal)

While RSA encryption is based on the hardness of factoring problem, there is another public key cryptography system based on hardness of Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP).

1. **Discrete Log Problem (DLP):** This is a cornerstone problem in public-key cryptography and underlies many key exchange and encryption algorithms. Understanding DLP provides a foundation for the remaining topics.

    - [Public key cryptography using discrete logarithms](https://www.di-mgt.com.au/public-key-crypto-discrete-logs-0.html)

2. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:** This is one of the earliest practical implementations of key exchange protocols based on the Discrete Log Problem. It's critical to understand how secure communication can be established over insecure channels.

    This protocol is significant as it enables secure communication over insecure channels by allowing two parties to generate a shared secret key, which can then be used for encryption and decryption of messages

### Cryptographic Commitments

Cryptographic commitments are essential in cryptography and blockchain technology as they allow for selective hiding and revealing of information. This feature ensures data privacy while still enabling verification processes.

It helps achieve secure and efficient verification of transactions in blockchain protocols. In such contexts, sensitive information, such as transaction details or user identities, is hidden while revealing others for the verifier to authenticate the transactions.

You can break down the concept of commitment into two parts: commit and open (reveal).

![commitment scheme](./assets/commitment.png)
[Source](https://zecrey.medium.com/commmitment-schemes-in-zecrey-e6c446e2da97)

There is always a commit phase and a reveal phase, in other words you first encrypt a secret and then reveal it later.

#### Pedersen Commitments (Optional)
Pedersen Commitments are a type of cryptographic primitive that allows you to commit to a certain value while keeping it hidden, with the ability to disclose the committed value later. They're often used to achieve privacy-preserving properties in cryptographic protocols. For more on Pedersen Commitments, review these materials:

### Intro to Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Elliptic curve cryptography builds upon traditional cryptographic principles by applying them to the mathematical structure of elliptic curves.

For example, there exists an **Elliptic Curve Discrete Log Problem (ECDLP)**. By using elliptic curves, it has certain benefits over the regular Discrete Log Problem (DLP). These links are a good place to start:

- [Elliptic Curves - Computerphile [8:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF1pwjL9-DE)
- [A (relatively easy to understand) primer on elliptic curve cryptography](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/)

**Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)** extends the traditional Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) by incorporating elliptic curves as well, enabling stronger security with shorter key lengths. This makes the algorithm more efficient and suitable for constrained environments. ECDSA is widely used in various secure communication protocols, including SSL/TLS.

The following StackExchange answer goes over the differences between some of the most popular digital signature protocols. It also leads into our next topic, which is another type of digital signature called the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).

### BLS Signatures

BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) signatures are a type of cryptographic signature scheme that allows for efficient aggregation of individual signatures into a single signature. It also makes use of pairing-based cryptography.

The intuition of BLS is that it is an aggregation signature. The image below shows how the public key and signature are aggregated. The advantage is that all signatures can be verified at once. That's why it is commonly used in consensus protocols.

### Pairing-Based Cryptography

Pairing-based cryptography underly many of the following topics. So it is important to know what it is, even if you might not need to know the specifics.

You can imagine pairing as the multiplication of elliptic curves. The original elliptic curve operation is homomorphically additive but not homomorphically multiplicative. Pairing is a way to mimic this "multiplication".

This is largely used in ZKPs, especially during the verification stage.
