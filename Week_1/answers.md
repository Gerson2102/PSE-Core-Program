### Circom programs

1. Proving a multiplication of two numbers: 

    ```rust
    pragma circom  2.1.9;

    template Multiplier() {
        signal input a;
        signal input b;
        signal output c;
        c <== a * b;
    }

    component main = Multiplier();
    ```

1. Proving an addition:

    ```rust
    pragma circom  2.1.9;

    template Addition() {
        signal input a;
        signal input b;
        signal output result;
        result <== a + b;
    }

    component main = Addition();
    ```

1. Proving a multiplication of three numbers:

    ```rust
    pragma circom  2.1.9;

    template Multiplier_V2() {
        signal input a;
        signal input b;
        signal input c;
        signal intermediate;
        signal output result;
        intermediate <== a * b; // In Circom we cant multiply three times in a row.
        result <== intermediate * c;
    }

    component main = Multiplier_V2();
    ```

### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption (AES, RSA) Questions

   1. **What is the primary difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?**: Symmetric encryption we only use one public key to encrypt and decrypt data. Asymetric encryption we use a public and private key to encrypt and decrypt the data, which makes it more secure.

   2. **Can you briefly explain how AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) works?:** The Advanced Encryption Standard take plaintext as an input. That plaintext is put it into a grid of 4x4. We apply an XOR operation to this plaintext, a substitution and permutation. These process is a round. We can have 10, 12, 14 rounds depending on the size of the plaintext. (128, 192, 256)

   3. **What makes RSA a popular choice for public-key encryption?**: The ability to exchange encrypted messages during communication without worrying if somebody can intercept the interaction.

### Hash Functions, Merkle Trees Questions

   1. **What is a hash function and what are its primary uses in cryptography?**: A hash function is a function that takes an input and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. Its primary uses in data integrity, digital signatures, ZKPs, blockchain and crypto, among others.

   2. **How does the SHA-256 hashing algorithm function, in simple terms?**: The SHA-256 hashing method takes an input and is divided in a series of mathematical operations. It divides the input and applies 64 rounds of operations.

   3. **What is the Poseidon hash function and why is it particularly useful in ZKPs?**: Poseidon is a cryptographic hash function specifically designed to be efficient in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Is particularly useful in ZKPs because is much faster adn cheaper than SHA-256. When SHA-256 was implemented in Zcash it took one minute for proofs.

   4. **Can you describe the structure of a Merkle tree?**: A Merkle Tree is a binary tree, but with hashes. We have leafs that are hashes. And the parents of this hashes, are the 2 leafs hashes concatenated and we apply a hash to this concatenation. Until having a hash root that represents the whole data in a tree.

   5. **How are Merkle trees used within the blockchain context?**: In Mining. Miners need to repeatedly hash data to produce an output that matches certain conditions to mine a valid block. The hash is saved in the block header, and every time that we are going to add a new block in the chain, we hash all the transactions list verify if the hash in the header of the block, is correct. And Verification, light nodes dont require a lot of resources. So we can give them a Merkle proof that a transaction is in a specific block. And then it can calculate different hashes until confirms if the Merkle proof is the same as the block header of the block. If it does, itâ€™s proof that the transaction was included in the block.

   6. **Why are Merkle trees useful for efficient and secure verification of large data structures?**: Because the root of a Merkle Tree is a hash that represents the whole data inside of it. Which it means that we just need to compare roots of trees to verify the integrity of the data.


### Digital Signatures (Schnorr) Questions

   1. **Can you describe what digital signatures are and why they are essential in digital communications?**: Digital signatures are a cryptographic mechanism that allows a person or entity to prove the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document. They are essential for digital communications because we can verify that a message was sent by the person we expect and the integrity of it.

   2. **Explain the workings of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)**:
