#### Diving Deeper:

1. **What is a finite group?**: A finite group is a group that has a finite number of elements. In mathematical terms, a group G is a set with a binary operation that satisfies the following properties:

    1. **Closure**: For any pair of elements \(a, b \in G\), the result of the operation \(a * b\) is also in \(G\).
    2. **Associativity**: For any trio of elements \(a, b, c \in G\), it holds that \((a * b) * c = a * (b * c)\).
    3. **Identity element**: There exists an element \(e \in G\) such that for any element \(a \in G\), it holds that \(e * a = a * e = a\).
    4. **Inverse element**: For each element \(a \in G\), there exists an element \(b \in G\) such that \(a * b = b * a = e\).

2. **What is a cyclic group?**

3. **What is a generator?**

4. **What are finite fields?**
