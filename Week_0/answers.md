#### Topics to Research

#### Fundamentals:

1. **Prime Numbers and Composite Numbers**:

   - **Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number is only divisible by 1 and the number itself. Examples of prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.

   - **Composite Numbers**: A composite number is a natural number greater than 1 that has more than two positive divisors. In other words, a composite number can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself. Examples of composite numbers include 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12.

1. **Greatest Common Divisors (GCD)**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without leaving a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4, because 4 is the largest number that divides both 8 and 12 without leaving a remainder. The GCD is also known as the greatest common factor (GCF) or highest common factor (HCF).

#### Modular Arithmetic and Congruence

1. **What is modular arithmetic?**: Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain value, known as the modulus. This is akin to the way the hours on a clock reset after reaching 12. In modular arithmetic, the modulus $n$ determines the range of numbers. The notation $a \equiv b \ (\text{mod} \ n)$ means that $a$ and $b$ leave the same remainder when divided by $n$. Formally, $a \equiv b \ (\text{mod} \ n)$ if and only if $n$ divides $a - b$.

For example, in modulo 5 arithmetic:

- $7 \equiv 2 \ (\text{mod} \ 5)$ because $7 - 2 = 5$, which is divisible by 5.
- $12 \equiv 2 \ (\text{mod} \ 5)$ because $12 - 2 = 10$, which is divisible by 5.

2. **Exploring congruence classes**: A congruence class modulo $n$ is a set of integers that are all congruent to each other modulo $n$. Each integer belongs to one and only one congruence class modulo $n$. The set of all such classes forms a complete system of residues modulo $n$.

   For a given modulus $n$, the congruence class of an integer $a$, denoted by $[a]_n$ or simply $a \mod n$, contains all integers that are congruent to $a$ modulo $n$. Formally, the congruence class of $a$ modulo $n$ is:

   $$[a]_n = \{a + kn \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

   where $\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of all integers. For example, with $n = 4$:

   - The congruence class $[0]_4$ includes $\{..., -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, ...\}$.
   - The congruence class $[1]_4$ includes $\{..., -7, -3, 1, 5, 9, ...\}$.
   - The congruence class $[2]_4$ includes $\{..., -6, -2, 2, 6, 10, ...\}$.
   - The congruence class $[3]_4$ includes $\{..., -5, -1, 3, 7, 11, ...\}$.

   These classes partition the set of all integers into distinct, non-overlapping sets, each represented by one of the integers from $0$ to $n-1$.

#### Group Theory

1. **What is a group structure?**: A **group structure** is a set $G$ combined with an operation \* that satisfies four fundamental properties known as the group axioms. These properties are:

   1. **Closure**: For any two elements $a, b \in G$, the result of the operation $a \cdot b$ is also in $G$.

   2. **Associativity**: For any three elements $a, b, c \in G$, it holds that $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.

   3. **Identity element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for any element $a \in G$, the equation $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a$ holds.

   4. **Inverse element**: For each element $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.

1. **What is a group operation?**: A **group operation** is a binary operation $*$ defined on a set $G$ that combines any two elements $a$ and $b$ to form another element $c$ (i.e., $a \cdot b = c$) within the same set. This operation must satisfy the following properties:

   1. **Closure**: For any two elements $a, b \in G$, the result of the operation $a \cdot b$ is also in $G$.

   2. **Associativity**: For any three elements $a, b, c \in G$, it holds that $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.

   3. **Identity element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for any element $a \in G$, the equation $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a$ holds.

   4. **Inverse element**: For each element $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.

The operation $*$ is central to the structure of the group and must be defined in such a way that these properties are satisfied.

#### Diving Deeper:

1. **What is a finite group?**: A finite group is a group that has a finite number of elements. In mathematical terms, a group G is a set with a binary operation that satisfies the following properties:

   - **Closure**: For any pair of elements $a, b \in G$, the result of the operation $a \cdot b$ is also in $G$.
   - **Associativity**: For any trio of elements $a, b, c \in G$, it holds that $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.
   - **Identity element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for any element $a \in G$, it holds that $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a$.
   - **Inverse element**: For each element $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e$.

2. **What is a cyclic group?**: A **cyclic group** is a group that can be generated by a single element. This means that there exists an element $g \in G$ such that all elements of $G$ can be expressed as powers (in the case of multiplicative groups) or multiples (in the case of additive groups) of $g$. Formally, if $G$ is a cyclic group, then all elements $h \in G$ can be written as $h = g^k$ for some integer $k$.

3. **What is a generator?**: A **generator** of a cyclic group is the element $g$ that can generate all the elements of the group through its powers or multiples. In a cyclic group $G$, the generator $g$ is such that:

   $$G = \{ g^k \mid k \in \mathbb{Z} \}$$

For $g$ to be a generator, it must have the property that all the powers (or multiples) of $g$ cover all the elements of the group.

4. **What are finite fields?**: A **finite field** (or Galois field) is a finite set $F$ with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfies the properties of a field. This means that:

   1. **Closure**: The addition and multiplication of two elements in $F$ result in an element in $F$.

   2. **Associativity**: The addition and multiplication are associative.
   3. **Commutativity**: The addition and multiplication are commutative.

   4. **Identity element**: There exists a zero element $0 \in F$ such that $0 + a = a$ for all $a \in F$, and there exists a one element $1 \in F$ such that $1 \cdot a = a$ for all $a \in F$.

   5. **Additive inverse**: For each element $a \in F$, there exists an element $-a \in F$ such that $a + (-a) = 0$.

   6. **Multiplicative inverse**: For each element $a \in F$ other than zero, there exists an element $a^{-1} \in F$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$.

   7. **Distributivity**: The multiplication is distributive over the addition; that is, $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$ for all $a, b, c \in F$.
