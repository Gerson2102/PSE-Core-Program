#### Diving Deeper:

1. **What is a finite group?**: A finite group is a group that has a finite number of elements. In mathematical terms, a group G is a set with a binary operation that satisfies the following properties:

    1. **Closure**: For any pair of elements \(a, b \in G\), the result of the operation \(a * b\) is also in \(G\).
    2. **Associativity**: For any trio of elements \(a, b, c \in G\), it holds that \((a * b) * c = a * (b * c)\).
    3. **Identity element**: There exists an element \(e \in G\) such that for any element \(a \in G\), it holds that \(e * a = a * e = a\).
    4. **Inverse element**: For each element \(a \in G\), there exists an element \(b \in G\) such that \(a * b = b * a = e\).

2. **What is a cyclic group?**: A **cyclic group** is a group that can be generated by a single element. This means that there exists an element \(g \in G\) such that all elements of \(G\) can be expressed as powers (in the case of multiplicative groups) or multiples (in the case of additive groups) of \(g\). Formally, if \(G\) is a cyclic group, then all elements \(h \in G\) can be written as \(h = g^k\) for some integer \(k\).

3. **What is a generator?**: A **generator** of a cyclic group is the element \(g\) that can generate all the elements of the group through its powers or multiples. In a cyclic group \(G\), the generator \(g\) is such that:

    \[
    G = \{ g^k \ | \ k \in \mathbb{Z} \}
    \]

For \(g\) to be a generator, it must have the property that all the powers (or multiples) of \(g\) cover all the elements of the group.


4. **What are finite fields?**: A **finite field** (or Galois field) is a finite set \(F\) with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfies the properties of a field. This means that:

    1. **Closure**: The addition and multiplication of two elements in \(F\) result in an element in \(F\).
    2. **Associativity**: The addition and multiplication are associative.
    3. **Commutativity**: The addition and multiplication are commutative.
    4. **Identity element**: There exists a zero element \(0 \in F\) such that \(0 + a = a\) for all \(a \in F\), and there exists a one element \(1 \in F\) such that \(1 \cdot a = a\) for all \(a \in F\).
    5. **Additive inverse**: For each element \(a \in F\), there exists an element \(-a \in F\) such that \(a + (-a) = 0\).
    6. **Multiplicative inverse**: For each element \(a \in F\) other than zero, there exists an element \(a^{-1} \in F\) such that \(a \cdot a^{-1} = 1\).
    7. **Distributivity**: The multiplication is distributive over the addition; that is, \(a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)\) for all \(a, b, c \in F\).
