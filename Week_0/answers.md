#### Topics to Research

#### Fundamentals:

1. **Prime Numbers and Composite Numbers**:
1. **Greatest Common Divisors (GCD)**

#### Modular Arithmetic and Congruence

1. **What is modular arithmetic?**: Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain value, known as the modulus. This is akin to the way the hours on a clock reset after reaching 12. In modular arithmetic, the modulus $n$ determines the range of numbers. The notation $a \equiv b \ (\text{mod} \ n)$ means that $a$ and $b$ leave the same remainder when divided by $n$. Formally, $a \equiv b \ (\text{mod} \ n)$ if and only if $n$ divides $a - b$.

For example, in modulo 5 arithmetic:

- $7 \equiv 2 \ (\text{mod} \ 5)$ because $7 - 2 = 5$, which is divisible by 5.
- $12 \equiv 2 \ (\text{mod} \ 5)$ because $12 - 2 = 10$, which is divisible by 5.

#### Group Theory

1. **What is a group structure?**: A **group structure** is a set $G$ combined with an operation \* that satisfies four fundamental properties known as the group axioms. These properties are:

   1. **Closure**: For any two elements $a, b \in G$, the result of the operation $a \cdot b$ is also in $G$.

   2. **Associativity**: For any three elements $a, b, c \in G$, it holds that $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.

   3. **Identity element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for any element $a \in G$, the equation $e\cdot a = a\cdot e = a$ holds.

   4. **Inverse element**: For each element $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.

1. **What is a group operation?**: A **group operation** is a binary operation $*$ defined on a set $G$ that combines any two elements $a$ and $b$ to form another element $c$ (i.e., $a \cdot b = c$) within the same set. This operation must satisfy the following properties:

   1. **Closure**: For any two elements $a, b \in G$, the result of the operation $a \cdot b$ is also in $G$.
   2. **Associativity**: For any three elements $a, b, c \in G$, it holds that $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.
   3. **Identity element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for any element $a \in G$, the equation $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a$ holds.
   4. **Inverse element**: For each element $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.

The operation $*$ is central to the structure of the group and must be defined in such a way that these properties are satisfied.

#### Diving Deeper:

1. **What is a finite group?**: A finite group is a group that has a finite number of elements. In mathematical terms, a group G is a set with a binary operation that satisfies the following properties:

   - **Closure**: For any pair of elements $a, b \in G$, the result of the operation $a \cdot b$ is also in $G$.
   - **Associativity**: For any trio of elements $a, b, c \in G$, it holds that $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.
   - **Identity element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for any element $a \in G$, it holds that $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a$.
   - **Inverse element**: For each element $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e$.

2. **What is a cyclic group?**: A **cyclic group** is a group that can be generated by a single element. This means that there exists an element $g \in G$ such that all elements of $G$ can be expressed as powers (in the case of multiplicative groups) or multiples (in the case of additive groups) of $g$. Formally, if $G$ is a cyclic group, then all elements $h \in G$ can be written as $h = g^k$ for some integer $k$.

3. **What is a generator?**: A **generator** of a cyclic group is the element $g$ that can generate all the elements of the group through its powers or multiples. In a cyclic group $G$, the generator $g$ is such that:

   $$G = \{ g^k \mid k \in \mathbb{Z} \}$$

For $g$ to be a generator, it must have the property that all the powers (or multiples) of $g$ cover all the elements of the group.

4. **What are finite fields?**: A **finite field** (or Galois field) is a finite set $F$ with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfies the properties of a field. This means that:

   1. **Closure**: The addition and multiplication of two elements in $F$ result in an element in $F$.

   2. **Associativity**: The addition and multiplication are associative.
   3. **Commutativity**: The addition and multiplication are commutative.

   4. **Identity element**: There exists a zero element $0 \in F$ such that $0 + a = a$ for all $a \in F$, and there exists a one element $1 \in F$ such that $1 \cdot a = a$ for all $a \in F$.

   5. **Additive inverse**: For each element $a \in F$, there exists an element $-a \in F$ such that $a + (-a) = 0$.

   6. **Multiplicative inverse**: For each element $a \in F$ other than zero, there exists an element $a^{-1} \in F$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$.

   7. **Distributivity**: The multiplication is distributive over the addition; that is, $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$ for all $a, b, c \in F$.
