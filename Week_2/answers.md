## Exercises

   1. **What is a proof system?**: A proof system is a cryptographic framework that allows a prover to convince a verifier that a certain statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the truth of the statement. In cryptography, this concept often refers to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), where the verifier learns nothing about the statement beyond its validity.

   2. **What is input, witness, circuit, and proof?**
      1. **Input:** This is the public information provided to both the prover and verifier. For instance, in a zero-knowledge proof, this could be a public parameter like the hash of a message, which both parties know.

      2. **Witness:** The witness is the secret information that only the prover knows. It acts as a solution to the problem the prover is trying to prove without revealing the witness itself. For example, in a zk-SNARK, the witness could be a set of values that satisfy a cryptographic circuit.

      3. **Circuit:** A circuit is a mathematical or logical structure that represents the computation or the problem being solved. It consists of gates that process inputs and outputs in a way similar to how electrical circuits function. In proof systems like zk-SNARKs, circuits are used to describe the problem the prover must solve and are translated into constraints.

      4. **Proof:** The proof is the final outcome generated by the prover that is sent to the verifier. It contains cryptographic evidence that the prover knows a valid witness for the problem without revealing the witness itself.

   3. **How does program convert to proof?**:
