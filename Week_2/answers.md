## Exercises

   1. **What is a proof system?**: A proof system is a cryptographic framework that allows a prover to convince a verifier that a certain statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the truth of the statement. In cryptography, this concept often refers to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), where the verifier learns nothing about the statement beyond its validity.

   2. **What is input, witness, circuit, and proof?**
      1. **Input:** This is the public information provided to both the prover and verifier. For instance, in a zero-knowledge proof, this could be a public parameter like the hash of a message, which both parties know.

      2. **Witness:** The witness is the secret information that only the prover knows. It acts as a solution to the problem the prover is trying to prove without revealing the witness itself. For example, in a zk-SNARK, the witness could be a set of values that satisfy a cryptographic circuit.

      3. **Circuit:** A circuit is a mathematical or logical structure that represents the computation or the problem being solved. It consists of gates that process inputs and outputs in a way similar to how electrical circuits function. In proof systems like zk-SNARKs, circuits are used to describe the problem the prover must solve and are translated into constraints.

      4. **Proof:** The proof is the final outcome generated by the prover that is sent to the verifier. It contains cryptographic evidence that the prover knows a valid witness for the problem without revealing the witness itself.

   3. **How does program convert to proof?**:
      1. **Translation to Circuit:** The computation (or program) is transformed into a circuit or a set of constraints. For example, a program's logic is modeled as a sequence of gates or a rank-1 constraint system (R1CS). This circuit represents the conditions that need to be satisfied by the witness.

      2. **Witness Generation:** The prover, who has access to private inputs (the witness), runs the program and generates values that satisfy the circuit. The witness is a set of secret values that complete the circuitâ€™s satisfiability.

      3. **Proving:** The prover uses the circuit and the witness to generate a proof. Depending on the proof system (e.g., zk-SNARK, zk-STARK), the prover applies cryptographic techniques like polynomial commitments or folding schemes to prove that they know a valid witness that satisfies the circuit.

      4. **Verification:** The verifier receives the proof and checks it against the public inputs and the circuit constraints. The verification process is much faster and more efficient than executing the full program, ensuring scalability in systems like blockchains.
