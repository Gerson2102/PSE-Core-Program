# Core Program

> A Foundation for Tomorrow's Open-Source ProgCrypto Contributors

Welcome to the Core Program curriculum repository, hosted by the Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team. This program covers the basics of programmable cryptography (ProgCrypto), including Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and Multiparty Computation (MPC). Our goal is to equip engineers and researchers to contribute to open-source cryptography projects.

Designed for programmers with limited cryptography knowledge, this self-learning curriculum helps them learn the fundamentals and prepares them to contribute to the open-source community.
